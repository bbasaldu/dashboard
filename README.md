# Responsive Dashboard using D3 and React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Based on this web design found on Dribble https://dribbble.com/shots/15994793-AI-Web-Dashboard-Concured

Built all components from scratch except for icons.
Navbar icons taken from Material UI icons.
Demonstrates my ability to follow web designs and develop them.
